#### 6. **Functionality**

   - [ ] All forms work as expected, including validation for required fields and error messages.
   - [ ] Dropdowns, checkboxes, and radio buttons are selectable and reflect the chosen options.
   - [ ] Modal dialogs open and close correctly, and focus remains within the modal while open.
